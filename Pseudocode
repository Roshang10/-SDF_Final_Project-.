Individual Final Project - Task Proposal
The app for Bio Zen 
Lucy Sommer

Track the location of the user on our GPS and find out exactly what they are looking for.

Have users create a profile on their account to continue tracking their progress and needs.

Connect user to either local doctor or more information about our company.

Have users document their progress on the app and allow the doctors to have access to their charts so they can have clear communication. 

Use the information given to us from both the app and the user to continue updating the app and making it better.
